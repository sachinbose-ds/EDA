This Jupyter Notebook contains an analysis of COVID-19 data using various data visualization techniques. The analysis includes the following tasks:

1. Data Loading: The COVID-19 dataset is loaded from the OWID COVID-19 Data repository.

2. Initial Exploration: The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to get an overview of the data.

3. Data Info and Summary: Information about the dataset, including data types and missing values, is provided. Summary statistics of the numerical columns are also displayed.

4. Data Cleaning: Missing values in the dataset are filled with zeros. The 'date' column is converted to a datetime format.

5. Total Cases Over Time for a Specific Country: Line plots are generated to visualize the total number of COVID-19 cases over time for specific countries.

6. New Cases Over Time for a Specific Country: Line plots are generated to visualize the number of new COVID-19 cases over time for specific countries.

7. Total Deaths Over Time for a Specific Country: Line plots are generated to visualize the total number of COVID-19 deaths over time for specific countries.

8. New Deaths Over Time for a Specific Country: Line plots are generated to visualize the number of new COVID-19 deaths over time for specific countries.

9. Total Cases Comparison Between Countries: Line plots are generated to compare the total number of COVID-19 cases between different countries.

10. Additional Visualizations: Line plots are generated to visualize new cases per million, total vaccinations, new vaccinations, and total tests over time for a specific country.

11. Dashboard Setup: A simple COVID-19 data dashboard is set up using the Dash library. The dashboard includes multiple line plots for different COVID-19 metrics.
